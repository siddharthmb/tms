1) Cronjob
	The linux utility of cron job will be handling the task of executing the terminal along with my project.

2) Argument reader and validator (class -- singleton)
	We just need one entity that can validate and read all the commandline arguments. This class will read the command line parameter and
	will make the decision whether we are running the process for the morning or the evening thingy.

3) A Base Class (name to be decided later)
	This will be a pure abstract class, from which we will derive two classes. One will handle the responsibility of morning and the 
	other of the evening. We are making these as two different classes because morning and evening functionalities will be totally
	different.

4) Morning & Evening Classes (again, names later)
	Morning will handle the responsibility of accepting the details, Evening will be asking the status. These classes can actually be singleton
	as well, but that I will think over and finalize later. However, these won't be dealing with file handling.

5) File Handler
	This class will essentially communicate with Morning and Evening for both the reading and writing operations over the files.

6) Logger
	This, I will have to read about and learn the log levels. Also, the level of logging will be provided as a command line argument. This is 
	what I am thinking as of now, but finalizing will be done later whether to keep a config file or just keep this as a command line argument.
	This class will be a singleton or not will be decided later as well.
	But this class will have to be absolutely 0 coupled with other classes so that I can use the same logger in other projects as well.
